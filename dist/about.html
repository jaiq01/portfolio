            I am computer programmer having in-depth knowledge about Computer
            Architecture, Compiler construction, Algorithms designing and
            Software Engineering principles. I worked in OOP paradigm i.e.
            designing system(software) architectures, class diagrams, object
            diagrams and ER Diagrams for many such systems i.e. POS, Blogging
            System, and work in Laravel PHP as well as in ASP.Net. I qualified
            in CS major having MS CS specialized in Software Engineering.

            I have participated in a workshop with Software industries
            practitioner / experts to polish my skills in OOP paradigm in PHP /
            Laravel framework, MVC pattern and design one complete project in
            guidance of experts. I really enjoyed the company of classmates and
            programming mentor in this workshop. I collaborated via GitHub with
            class mates and programming mentor on the assigned project.

            I really shine in designing of logistic code / algorithmic modules
            that can be reusable and scalable. I have worked in designing
            software system at logic layer of three-layered architecture and
            design business logic in very impressive way that accommodate user
            changes in requirement as easy as possible. I really belief that
            designing generalized algorithms and then extending them to
            specialized algorithms are very easy and scalable that conform to
            open/close principle. I work in C# while developing using ASP.Net
            and use PHP while working in larvel Frame Work.

            I started my career from teaching that what I have learned in CS /
            about programming to teach others and expand my knowledge by
            teaching others and explored the concepts related to programming and
            computer science as general. I teach from secondary level to master
            level subjects of computer science especially C/C++, Database, and
            software engineering. I teach fundamentals of programming and
            different paradigm of programming to others. I motivated my students
            to explore more own their own to excel in their study and especially
            in computer programming.
